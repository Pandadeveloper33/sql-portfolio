As a risk analyst at an eCommerce company, your job is to detect suspicious seller activity. You'll use SQL queries to identify:
- Sellers with unusually high refund rates
- Duplicate orders by same buyer
- Orders from mismatched locations
- Suspicious transaction patterns

Your goal is to flag risky sellers using only SQL queries on the sales and refund data.
